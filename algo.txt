algorithm for calculating gpa

1. Get all the courses and their various scores

2. convert each course score/grade to the appropriate point (based on the point sytem, e.g B equals 4 points)

3.add all the points together

4. get the sum of all the courses credit units...i.e the credit load for that semester

5. finally divide the result in step3 with step 4....i.e totalscoreforindividualgp/creditunitforthesemester


also note that range in python is non-inclusive so range(0, 10) actually means from 0-9 the 10 is not included

the gpa for a level is the 1st semester + 2semester divided by 2

while your cgpa is all the gpa's for a level divided by the number of years for the course
